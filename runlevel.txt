We can only use one mode or runlevel at a time
Single User Mode is used for troubleshooting errors.
rd.break at startup
 init command is still working but its replaced by systemctl
To do permanent changes we can use systemctl set-default ----
production servers runs of runlevel 3 or 5. 
3 is cli mode
5 is gui mode 
there are total 7 modes (0-6) in runlevels
0 is for shutdown 
6 is for reboot
3 is for cli mode
5 is for gui mode
2 is for cli without network
4 is blank
1 is for single usermode

Run Levels (Traditional SysVinit)
Historically, Linux distributions, including older RHEL versions (prior to RHEL 7), used the SysVinit system, which relied on run levels. A run level is a numerical representation of a system's operating state, determining which services are started or stopped.


Standard Run Levels:

0 (Halt): Shuts down the system.

1 (Single-User Mode/Rescue Mode): A minimal environment for administrative tasks and troubleshooting. Only the root user can log in, and networking is typically disabled.

2 (Multi-User Mode without Networking): Multi-user mode, but without network services configured. Often used for custom, user-defined configurations.

3 (Multi-User Mode with Networking): The standard text-based multi-user mode with full networking. Most server environments default to this run level.

4 (User-Definable): Reserved for custom purposes; often configured similar to run level 3.

5 (Graphical Multi-User Mode with Networking/X11): Similar to run level 3, but also starts a graphical display manager (GUI). Most desktop Linux systems and servers with a GUI default to this.

6 (Reboot): Reboots the system.

How SysVinit Worked:

The init program (Process ID 1) was responsible for reading the /etc/inittab file to determine the default run level.

Services were managed by scripts in directories like /etc/rc.d/rc0.d, /etc/rc.d/rc1.d, etc., corresponding to each run level. When switching run levels, init would execute K (kill) scripts from the old run level's directory and S (start) scripts from the new run level's directory.

Commands like init <runlevel> or telinit <runlevel> were used to switch run levels.

chkconfig was used to enable or disable services for specific run levels.

2. Targets (Modern systemd)
Starting with RHEL 7, systemd replaced SysVinit as the default init system. systemd introduced the concept of targets, which are a more flexible and robust way of managing system states and services.


Key Concepts of systemd Targets:

Logical Groupings: Targets are essentially a collection of systemd units (services, sockets, mount points, etc.) that define a specific system state.

Named, Not Numbered: Unlike run levels, targets have descriptive names (e.g., multi-user.target, graphical.target).

Parallelization: systemd can start services in parallel, significantly speeding up boot times, which was a limitation of the sequential nature of SysVinit run levels.

Dependencies: Targets have clear dependencies on other units and targets, ensuring services start in the correct order.

Flexibility: Multiple targets can be active concurrently, allowing for more granular control over the system's state.
